# Data Management <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->
Data management on SIUE systems involves managing, sharing, and transferring files. All research projects should have a data management plan to maximize research productivity on SIUE systems.

#### File systems
For detailed information on the available file systems, see the [Storage File Systems](user_guides/data_management/storage_file_systems.md) user guide.

#### Managing and sharing files
File management involves organizing, sharing, backing up, and archiving files. On SIUE systems, this can be achieved using various command-line tools.

For more information, see the [Managing Files Using the Command Line](user_guides/data_management/manage_files_command_line.md) user guide.

#### Transferring files
Secure and efficient data transfer to and from SIUE systems can be achieved with a variety of useful tools, the choice of which depends on whether the storage location is a personal computer or an external site (e.g., cloud storage). The choice also depends heavily on the requirement of data sensitivity as well as the familiarity of the user. There are three methods of data transfer that we recommend for use with SIUE systems: **command-line tools**, **graphical tools**, and the **Globus service**.

For more information, see the [File Transfer Overview](user_guides/data_management/file_transfer_overview.md) user guide.
